1.  Thank organizers The beauty of the city and the  hospitatlity of the hosts are unmatched.

2.  Bonnie's Assembly

Bonnie Chen is a very talented student who just graduate and was interested in how the chromatin landscape is re-establiehdd after passage of teh fork

While obvious to this audience, when I was part of the ENCODE consortium my colleagues would ask why study dna replication transcriptional regulation is much more intersting -- and I would have to point out that their precise chromatin regualtory landcscape driving transcription has to be disasseblme and assembled at the replicatino forks.

3.  ahead of the replication fork the nucleosomes are dissassmled and parental
    h3-h4 tetramers are recycled to the leading and lagging strands.

there are two axes of parental histone inheritance to ensure equal inheritance of
   parental hisone on the leading and laggin strand medidated by numerous
histone chaperones and factors at the replciation fork, including pol
episplon, mcm and pol alpha.  

work from many groups here including qing li, zhigou and chinle yu have
elucidated many of the histone chaperones that facililtte inheritance to the leading
and laggin strand

There are not enough parental histones for both strands so nascent h3-h4
tetramers mush also be incorporated into both strands.

Nascent H3-H4 tetramers are deposited by CAF-1 onto the leading or lagging
strand

The recycling of parental histones at the fork is critical for preserving local epigenetic environemmtn

mention h2ab dimers are brought in later from broader pool

4.  Here is a simplied model focusing on the factors in today talk.  The Dpb3
    subnit of pol episplon transfers parental histoen h3-h4 tetramers to the leading
strand and the Mcm2 subunit  of teh replicative helicase mcm2-7 transfers
pareental histones to the lagging strand.  The CAF-1 histone chaperone deposits
nacsent h3-h4 tetramers to either strand.


Bonnie was interested in understanding the impact of loss of caf-1 on the
re-establishement of the chromatin landscape behind the replication fork.
CAF-1 is essential in mammalian cells, but in yeast it is not esssential and
loss of CAF-1 activity results in    

4.  Silencing defects, increased sensitivity to DNA damage and increased
    crytptic transcription -- suggesting that loss of caf-1 and 
defects in the     deposition of nascent h3-h4 tetramers may disrupt the local chromatin
    structure.  To explore this -- bonnie used our chromatin occupancy profling
    assay.

5.  Chromatin occupacny profiling -- on cik1.  Bonnie pefromed this assay in
   cells lacking caf-1 and the steady state chromatin landscape was indistinquishable from
wt.  Maybe its a maturation defect?

11.  Nascent chromatiin occupancy profiling.  Async, no drugs to synchrnoize

12.  WT nucleosome assembly and maturation is very fast.  with 10 minutes of
     passsage the fork.

13.  Loss of caf-1 delays maturation.  In the absnece of caf-1 we see an
     increase in small mnase protected fragments [we'll come back to these] in the pulse and the chromatin
takes considerably longer to mature.

14. here we've zoomed in and you can see not only the small fragments but also
    the delay in chromatin maturation and organization. In particular this
nucleosome is not full ouccpied until the end of the chase period

15.  We observed this throughout the genome, here we are plotting the maturation
     of kinetics of approximately 50,000 nucleosomes throughout the yeast genome
     and in contrat to wt we see both fast and slow maturing nucleosomes in the
     absence of caf-1
     
16.  We interpret these smalll fragments in delta cac1 cells to be
     subnucleosomal fragments likely representing h3-h4 tetramers suggesting
that caf-1 facilitates both deposition and maturation of nascent h3-h4
tetramers.

What are the consequences of delayed maturation?

17.  Loss of caf-1 and delayed chromatin maturation results in a transient s-phase specific increase in cryptic transcription.  here we are plottiing the relative levels of antisense transcription as a proxy for cryptic transcription.

18.  Loss of caf-1 also resullts in an sphase specific  loss of subtelomeric
     silencing.   


19.  Bonnie next wanted to know if there were sprand specific differences in
     chromatin maturation behind the replication fork on either the leading or
lagging strand.

20.  She adopted our nascent chromatin occupancy profiling assay to capture
     strans specific infomration by denaturing the dna prior to capture.

21. We are pulse labeling an asynchronous population and getting strand specific
    information throughout the genome, but at origins due to the 5 prime to 3
prime synthesis reuqirement and the bidirectional nature of DNA replication
there will be asymmetric leading and lagging strands distributed around the
orgins. Reads that map to the crick strand and up stream of the origin represent
leading strand and those crick reads downstream of the origin represent lagging
and vice versa on the watson strand.  The rest of the data will be presented in
this orientation with strand specific watson and crick reads.

22.  Here is the strand specific distribution of reads in WT cells relative to
     active replication origins.  We already have well established chromatin
during the pulse consistent with the rapid maturation of nucleosomes in wt
cells.  We don't see any strand specific biases.  And here is the chase.


23.  wt assembly, we have parental h3-h4 tetramers being distribued to both
     leading and lagging strand with rapid maturation into full nucleosomes and
     no strand bias.

24.  in cells deleted for cac1 we see an accumulation of small fragments which
     we interpret to be nascent h3-h4 tetramters at about 70-75 bp that have a
maturatino delay, but the distribution
     is indistinquishable on the leading and laggging strands. and again we can
     observe the maturation in the chase.

25. cac1 assembly.  presumably we have parental h3-h4 tetramers being deposited
    to the leading and lagging strands and nascent h3-h4 tetramers are still
being deposited (presumably by rtt106 and FACT), but exhibbit a delay in
maturation.

26. in an mcm2-3a mutant we expect to disrupt transfer of parental h3-h4
    tetramers to the lagging strand and thus the lagging strand should be
enriched for nascent tetramers.  We observe a slight accumulation of presumably
nascent h3-h4 tetramers on the lagging strand.  

27. which we can quantify to
illustrate the laggign strand bias. 

28.  and again the bias elminated in mature chromatin.

29. in an mcm2-3a mutant we disrupt transfer of parental histones to the lagging
    strand.  because we see a delay in maturation on the lagging strand it
suggestes that nascent h3-h4 tetramers mature more slowly than parental
tetramers.

30.  We can exagerate these strand specific differences in a cac1 mcm2-3 a
     mutant we now see signficnat acchumlation of small fragements representing
     h3-h4 tetrarmers on the lagging strand.  

31.  And again the chromatin matures to its final state in the chase.

32.  in cac1 mcm2-3a asssembly we see afurther delay in nascent tetramer
     maturation and a strong lagging strand bias.  

33.  Finally, if we delete dpb3 in the absence of cac1 we switch the polairtty
     of the small h3-h4 tetramer fragments to the leading strand.

34.  and again the chromatin fully returns to its native state following
     maturation.

35.  In summary. iCAF-1 facilitates both deposition and maturation of nascent H3-H4 tetramers
Loss of CAF-1 causes S-phase specific deregulation of transcription and silencing
Differential maturation kinetics for parental and nascent tetramers:
Strand-independent
Nascent tetramers mature slower than parental
CAF-1 loss further delays maturation

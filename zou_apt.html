<!-- Slide for Executive Summary -->

<section>
    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">Dr. Lee Zou is an internationally recognized leader in the genome integrity and DNA damage response fields. Since opening his independent lab at MGH in 2004, his scientific contributions have been highly influential, with a publication record that exceeds 130 papers in prestigious journals and an h-index of 59. His leadership experience and service record are impressive, as is his track record for mentoring postdoctoral fellows.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">However, Dr. Zou's mentoring of Ph.D. students has been limited due to constraints at Harvard, and there is a lack of available teaching evaluations. Despite these challenges, Dr. Zou's strengths, including his research, leadership, and service, make him an exceptional candidate for the rank of Professor with Tenure in the Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology.</p>
</section>


        <section>
            <h3>Research Field</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">Dr. Zou is a pre-eminent scholar in the field of <strong>genome integrity</strong>, with a focus on the <strong>DNA damage response</strong>. This field involves the replication, repair, and segregation of DNA, and is crucial for the maintenance of genome integrity. Dr. Zou's work is focused on understanding how cells signal and respond to DNA damage and stalled DNA replication forks.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">Dr. Zou has published <strong>over 130 high-impact publications</strong>, contributing significant insights such as the identification of single-stranded DNA as the key signal for activating the ATR-dependent DNA damage response and the role of ATR in DSB repair, DNA synthesis, and chromosome segregation.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">His research also delves into <strong>cancer biology</strong>, studying how the ATR-mediated DNA damage response is altered in cancer cells and how these differences can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.</p>
        </section>


<section>
    <h3>Professional Development</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 0.7em;">
        <li><strong>Graduate Studies:</strong> Under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Stillman at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, discovered a conserved factor, Cdc45, essential for the initiation of DNA replication (Zou et al., MCB, 1997; Zou and Stillman, Science, 1998).</li>
        <li><strong>Postdoctoral Fellowship:</strong> Working in Stephen Elledge's lab at Baylor College of Medicine, he defined the role of single-strand DNA as the molecular trigger for the activation of ATR, a key sensor of DNA damage and replication stress (Zou and Elledge, Science, 2003; Zou et al., PNAS, 2004).</li>
        <li><strong>Faculty:</strong> In his independent lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Zou made significant strides in understanding the mechanisms regulating ATR signaling and the DNA damage response in human cells, leading to key insights about how ATR activation is modulated (Shiotani and Zou, Mol Cell, 2008; Liu et al., Mol Cell, 2011).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Slide 2: Current Research Interests -->
<section>
    <h3>Current Research Interests</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 0.7em;">
        <li><strong>Genome Maintenance:</strong> Pioneered in understanding the role of ATR signalling in various aspects of genome maintenance, including chromosome segregation (Kabeche et al., Science, 2018).</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres:</strong> Made significant advances in elucidating the mechanisms and implications of the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway (Flynn et al., Nature, 2011; Flynn et al., Science, 2014; Zhang et al., Mol Cell, 2021; Yadav et al., Mol Cell, 2022).</li>
        <li><strong>Interplay between Gene Expression, DNA Repair, and Chromosome Organization:</strong> Investigating the dynamic interaction between these critical cellular processes, with a recent focus on the role of transcription in D-loop formation during homologous recombination at double-strand breaks (Ouyang et al., Nature, 2021).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Future Directions</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 0.7em;">
        <li>Identifying the types of replication stress associated with different cancer types and exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting ATR and the DNA damage response.</li>
        <li>Focusing on the reliance of a subset of cancers on alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), providing a unique therapeutic opportunity for ATR inhibitors.</li>
        <li>Translating fundamental research into promising clinical trials, leading to mechanism-based treatments for cancer patients.</li>
    </ul>
